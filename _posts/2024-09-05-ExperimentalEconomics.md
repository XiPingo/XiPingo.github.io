Welcome to the homepage of **Experimental Economics** !   
Tips:    
If we all go for the blonde, we block each other. Not a single one of us is gonna get her. So then we go for her friends, but they will all give us the cold shoulder because nobody likes to be second choice. But what if no one goes for the blonde? We don't block each other, and we don't insult the other girls. That's the only way we win.
