## Tips of Intermediate Macroeconomics   

 This course, based on Professor Li Jian's introductory macroeconomics, is specifically designed for the Economics Elite Program. While its content covers advanced macroeconomics, the primary focus is on model derivation, which is highly challenging and somewhat disconnected from the fundamental principles of macroeconomics.
